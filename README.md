### [Arm64 Assembly To Hex](https://github.com/ChrxnZ/Tools-I-Use-For-Coding-Or-Modding/blob/main/Online_Arm64Asm_To_Hex.lua):
* A Small GameGuardian Script I Made To Convert Arm64 Assembly To Hex Using ***gg.MakeRequest***, Very Useful Since You Dont Have To Switch Between Tabs To Convert It On The Site.
### [Hex To Deciaml / Decimal To Hex](https://github.com/ChrxnZ/Tools-I-Use-For-Coding-Or-Modding/blob/main/HexToDecimal_And_DecimalToHex.lua)
* A GameGuardian Script Made By [MAARS](https://gameguardian.net/forum/profile/1138303-maars/) To Turn Hex To Deciaml Or Decimal To Hex, Very Useful When Working With Function Static Bytes In Function Signatures
### [Script Loader](https://github.com/ChrxnZ/Tools-I-Use-For-Coding-Or-Modding/blob/main/Script_Loader.lua)
* A GameGuardian Script Made By [MAARS](https://gameguardian.net/forum/profile/1138303-maars/) To Load Scripts, Very Useful When Your Like Me, (Who Makes Hella Scripts And Cant Arrange Them Easily)!
